### Functions

`Constructor` Initializes the ERC-20 token with the specified name and symbol.

- Sets the contract deployer as the owner.
- Mints and InitialSupply of `10e18` to the owner.

`mint()`,allows only the owner of the contract to mint new tokens.

```sh
 function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
```

`transfer`, allows players to transfer their tokens to others.

```sh
 function transfer(
        address to,
        uint256 value
    ) public virtual override returns (bool success) {
        require(balanceOf(msg.sender) >= value, "Insufficient balance");
        success = super.transfer(to, value);
    }
```

`redeemToken`, allows players to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.

```sh
function redeemToken(uint8 _itemID) public {
        if (_itemID >= itemId) revert ItemNotFound();

        transfer(
            IdToGameItemsInfo[_itemID].owner,
            IdToGameItemsInfo[_itemID].amount
        );
        IdToGameItemsInfo[_itemID].owner = msg.sender;
    }
```

`balanceOf`, allows players to check their token balance at any time.

```sh

function balanceOf(
        address _account
    ) public view override returns (uint256) {
        return super.balanceOf(_account);
    }

```

`burn`, allows anyone to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.

```sh
   function burn(uint _amount) public {
        // checks that balance is not greater that amount
        if (balanceOf(msg.sender) < _amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
        _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    }

```

`createGameItems`, allows Degen game studio to create game items for its users.

```sh
 function createGameItems(
        string calldata _name,
        uint256 _amount
    ) public onlyOwner {
        itemId++;

        GameItemsInfo storage gameItemsInfo = IdToGameItemsInfo[itemId];

        gameItemsInfo.owner = msg.sender;
        gameItemsInfo.name = _name;
        gameItemsInfo.amount = _amount;

        IdToGameItemsInfo[itemId] = gameItemsInfo;
    }

```
